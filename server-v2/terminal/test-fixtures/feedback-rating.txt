I've completed the implementation of the pattern versioning system.

Summary:
- Created pattern registry with version metadata
- Added test fixtures for all prompt types
- Implemented confidence scoring with multi-match weighting
- All tests passing (265 total)

The system is now ready to track pattern changes across Claude Code versions.
