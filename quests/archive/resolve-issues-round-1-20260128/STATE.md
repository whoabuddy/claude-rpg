- 2026-01-27: Quest created with 8 phases covering 21 open issues. Phase ordering: notifications first (foundation for feedback), then quest/API management (meta-improvements), then features (competitions, observability, dashboard), then navigation/management, UX polish, and finally RPG/achievements. Previous quest (Fix Usability Bugs, 7 phases) archived to quests/fix-usability-bugs/. Issues #66, #67, #68, #78 closed as already resolved by PR #79.
